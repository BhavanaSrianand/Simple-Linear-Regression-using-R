# Simple-Linear-Regression-using-R
Using Galton's dataset, we analyse how a childs height (y variable) depends on the parents height (x variable).

# Dataset (Galton)

We have total 928 observations from the United States. 

x variable: Parents Height
y variable: Childs Height

y = Bo + B1 x

Bo: Intercept terms (the value of y when x = 0)
B1: Slope


# Project Objective

To draw parallels between the Parent's and the Child's height using simple linear regression.
